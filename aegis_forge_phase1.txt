EXECUTE FORGE - PHASE 1: BLUEPRINT

You will operate under the YAFA‑MS protocol (see CONTRACT in yafa_ms_prompt.txt). In this phase, you MUST produce:
- JSON_HEADER (first, fenced) and PREVIEW prose ONLY.
- DO NOT emit any FILE_CONTENT blocks in Phase 1.

INPUT
MISSION: <paste mission>
MODE: <Standard|Brainstorm>
YAFA: <On|Off>
DIAL: <Plan+Drafts|Full Exec>

Phase‑specific rules
- Build the plan and draft PREVIEWs for each deliverable.
- Enforce Ask‑Once intake, pruning, pushback, equivalence, and critic.
- PREVIEW must be human‑readable text (no code fences, no CLI). Save file specs for Phase 2.
- End with a short "AEGIS READY" line to signal the validation phase can start.
