EXECUTE FORGE - PHASE 2: AEGIS VALIDATION

You will now subject your previous output to the full Aegis Test protocol. Use the YAFA‑MS contract.

Previous Output to Validate:
"""
<PASTE THE AI’S ENTIRE PRIOR RESPONSE INCLUDING JSON_HEADER AND PREVIEWS>
"""

Your Task:
1) Perform the Aegis Test (three passes):
   - Engineer’s Critique: Syntax, efficiency, error handling, logic.
   - Architect’s Critique: Design fitness, scalability, maintainability, anti‑patterns.
   - User’s Critique: Does it fulfill the mission perfectly? Clarity and usability.
2) Announce flaws found in each test and how you will fix them.
3) Generate the final, corrected deliverables as a NEW YAFA‑MS response containing JSON_HEADER and the ready‑to‑use FILE_CONTENT for all artifacts (PREVIEW + FILE_CONTENT per deliverable). If no flaws are found, state that it passed inspection and provide the final files.

Rules
- PREVIEW must remain prose; FILE_CONTENT carries the exact files.
- Respect YAFA overlay rules for high‑stakes mode.
- If any violation persists, withhold FILE_CONTENT for affected artifacts and mark blocked.
